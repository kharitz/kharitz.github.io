## Who am I, and what do I do?

I’m Karthik Gopinath, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital & Harvard Medical School. I specialize in computational biophysics, using AI and machine learning to solve complex molecular interactions and biomedical challenges. Beyond research, I enjoy mentoring and fostering innovation in AI-driven healthcare.

Outside work, I’m an avid traveler, a technology enthusiast, and a passionate advocate for open science.

## What hardware do I use?

I rely heavily on my Mac

## And what software?

My main workstation runs Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with a custom GNOME environment for optimized productivity. My research workflows heavily involve Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow, and SciPy), Jupyter Notebooks, and molecular modeling software like GROMACS and VMD. 

For writing, I rely on Overleaf and Zotero for reference management. My go-to IDE is Visual Studio Code with a variety of extensions for Python and markdown. For managing notes and tasks, I use Notion and Todoist, syncing seamlessly across devices.

I’m a regular user of cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, and GitHub Actions for deploying and automating workflows. For secure collaboration, I rely on Slack, Zoom, and encrypted messaging apps.

On mobile, my most-used apps are Feedly, Mendeley, Keep, and Evernote. When unwinding, I use Spotify, Kindle, and the occasional puzzle game.

## What would be my dream setup?

My dream setup would include a lightweight laptop with the computational power of a top-tier workstation, days of battery life, and seamless cloud integration for syncing HPC workflows. A modular neural interface for coding directly from thought processes wouldn’t hurt either!
